# Formalization roadmap

Goal: a sorry-free proof of `Prop51.CoefficientNegativity` (`Prop51/Main.lean`),
with the axiom footprint documented by `scripts/AxiomsReport.lean`.

## Layer A — the power-series bridge (statement-level, pure ℚ)

Connect the recurrence-defined objects to the official power series.
No real analysis; everything is coefficient identities over ℚ.

- [x] `A r := (6r)!/((3r)!(2r)!·72^r)` and the ratio identity
      `(k+1)·A_{k+1} = 6(k+1/6)(k+5/6)·A_k` (clears to integers).
- [x] exp-characterization: for `F` with `F₀ = 1`, `n·F_n = Σ_{j≤n} j·L_j·F_{n-j}`
      iff `F = exp(Σ L_r t^r)` as `PowerSeries ℚ` (uniqueness by strong
      induction; existence = our `expList`).
- [x] the bridge identity `r·A_r = Σ_{j=1}^r j·c_j·A_{r-j}` (i.e. `c = log C`;
      from the hypergeometric ratio + the Riccati recurrence — the one real
      lemma of this layer; verified numerically to r = 40 exactly).
- [x] `bCoeff μ a = PowerSeries.coeff a (Π_i C(t/qᵢ) * (C^N)⁻¹)`.
- [x] majorant inequality `b_a(μ) ≤ U_a(N)` (paper eq. 8): coefficientwise
      domination `P_k(μ) ≤ Q_k(N)` by induction on the exp-recurrence
      (monotonicity in the exponent α over ℚ≥0), plus sign bookkeeping.
- [x] `c_pos`, `c_r ≤ A_r` (via the bridge identity).
- [x] (Layer C prep) `d`-normalization `c_r = 6^r (r-1)! d_r`, `d`
      nondecreasing, `5/36 ≤ d_r ≤ 4/25` — done, `Prop51/DNorm.lean`
      (see Layer C below for the rationalization).

## Layer A′ — partition quantifier upgrade

- [ ] `mem_partitions_iff`: completeness of the generator
      (`μ ∈ partitions n ↔ μ.sum = n ∧ sorted-desc ∧ positive parts`).
- [ ] permutation-invariance of `bCoeff` (it factors through the multiset of
      parts); upgrade `bCoeff_neg_g_le_23` to the `IsPartitionOf` form.
- [ ] optional: align with `Mathlib.Combinatorics.Partition` / `Nat.Partition`.

## Layer B — interval certificate `61 ≤ a ≤ 400` — **done**

- [x] verified dyadic interval arithmetic: `Prop51Kernel.lean` (executable,
      Mathlib-free, natively precompiled) + `Prop51/Dyadic.lean` (enclosure
      semantics over `ℚ`; 192-bit mantissas with outward rounding, the
      working precision of the reference Arb run).  Hand-rolled rather than
      girving/interval: the soundness statements stay in `ℚ`, no extra
      dependency, and rounding soundness reduces to floor/ceil facts.
- [x] interval port of the recurrences with per-`N` shared tables
      (`bTab`/`qTab`); the *unnormalized* `B`/`Q` recurrences are tracked
      directly (termwise a constant rescale of the certificate's `X`/`Y`
      form, so numerically identical), which lets soundness reuse the exact
      `expList` specs of Layer A verbatim.  Sign handling via `DI.hull0`
      (hull with `{0}`) — strictly conservative, no interval sign decision.
- [x] `native_decide` over all 470,220 pairs `61 ≤ a ≤ 400` (the 10,764
      pairs `a ≤ 60` stay with the exact certificate): 8 equal-work chunks
      (`CertificateInterval1-8.lean`, ~4 min each, parallel under
      `lake build`), assembled into `unorm_neg_61_400` / `unorm_neg_9_400`,
      capstone `coefficientNegativity_of_g_le_1199`.

## Layer C — the effective tail `a ≥ 401`

The paper's §§2–6 with explicit constants.  **Design decision (2026-06-12):
everything is rationalized — no `Real`, no `π`, no `e`, no Mathlib analysis.**
Each transcendental ingredient of the paper is replaced by a rational
surrogate, with the constant degradation absorbed by the sign-lock budget
(`2215` allowed vs. `20340` available — an order of magnitude of slack):

* `d_r ≤ 1/(2π)`  →  `d_r ≤ 4/25` via the exact `F`-ratio
  `1 + 5/(36r(r+1))` plus a Weierstrass product bound (`Π(1+xᵢ) ≤ 1/(1−Σxᵢ)`),
  pinned at `F₃·(108/103) = 0.15935 ≤ 0.16`;
* `1/π²` in the increment control  →  `(4/25)² · 4 = 64/625`;
* Stirling `r! ≥ (r/e)^r`  →  `r! ≥ (25r/68)^r`, by induction from
  `(1+1/n)^n ≤ Σ 1/k! ≤ 68/25` (binomial theorem + partial sum + geometric
  tail — all in ℚ);
* `exp` evaluations at rational points  →  partial sums + geometric tail
  majorants (`Σ_{t≤T} y^t/t! ≤ Σ_{t<T₀} y^t/t! + (y^{T₀}/T₀!)/(1−y/T₀)`,
  uniform in `T`); the infinite Poisson moments of §5 are finite sums here
  (`s ≤ m/3`), bounded by such surrogates;
* the alternating leading term `e^{-ζ}(1-2/m)`  →  a truncated alternating
  sum with first-omitted-term remainder (parity trick), reduced to a
  one-variable polynomial inequality on `0 ≤ ζ ≤ 50/27`;
* the §6 window scan  →  `native_decide` over exact rationals / the Layer B
  dyadic kernel; the `a > 2000` entropy tail  →  `C(n,k) ≥ (n/k)^k`.

Status:

- [x] reciprocal-binomial lemmas (paper Lemma 2.2): `Σ 1/C(n,i) ≤ 4/n`,
      middle-term variant `≤ 10/(n(n-1))` (`Prop51/BinomRecip.lean`).
- [x] `d`-normalization (paper Lemma 2.1, rationalized): recurrence,
      monotonicity, `5/36 ≤ d_r ≤ 4/25`, increment control
      `d_r − d_{r-1} ≤ (64/625)/(r(r-1))`, telescoped ratio bound
      `1 − (2304/3125)s/(m(m-s)) ≤ d_{m-s}/d_m ≤ 1`; workhorse bounds
      `(5/36)·6^r(r-1)! ≤ c_r ≤ (4/25)·6^r(r-1)!` (`Prop51/DNorm.lean`).
- [x] composition lemma (paper Lemma 3.1): `G_r(p) ≤ 4^{r-1}(p-2r+1)!`
      in recursive convolution form (`Prop51/Composition.lean`).
- [x] rational Stirling lower bound `r! ≥ (25r/68)^r` and the partial-exp
      majorant machinery: `Σ_{t<T} y^t/t! ≤ Σ_{t<T₀} y^t/t!
      + (y^{T₀}/T₀!)/(1−y/T₀)` uniformly in `T`; `(1+1/n)^n ≤ 68/25` via
      the binomial theorem and `Σ 1/k! ≤ 1631/600`
      (`Prop51/ExpBounds.lean`).
- [x] `H`-power machinery (`Prop51/HPow.lean`): the exponential formula
      `expCoeff L p = Σ_{r≤p} [t^p]((mk L)^r)/r!` (finite, via the
      θ-power rule `θ(G^{r+1}) = (r+1)·G^r·θG` and a double-sum swap);
      the power bound `|[t^p]G^r| ≤ M^r 6^p Gcomp r p` for `L` supported
      in degrees ≥ 2 with `|L_j| ≤ M·6^j(j-1)!` (the `Gcomp` recursion
      consumed verbatim); `hpow r p = [t^p]H^r` with `hpow_eq_zero` for
      `p < 2r`; the exact block split
      `E⁻_p(N) = -N c_p + Σ_{r=2}^p (-N)^r [t^p]H^r/r!` and the residual
      bound `|E⁻_p + N c_p| ≤ Σ_{r≥2} (4N/25)^r 6^p Gcomp r p / r!`.
- [x] Δ-envelope scaffold (`Prop51/Envelope.lean`): rationalized
      `DeltaRat` with coefficient `(36/5)(4/25)^r4^{r-1}`, block domination
      from `Gcomp_le` and `c_lb`, and the normalized bridge
      `|E⁻_p/(-Nc_p)-1| ≤ DeltaRat p N`.
- [x] the Δ-envelope numerics (Lemma 4.1, `Envelope.lean`): from
      `Eminus_residual_le`, the normalized bound `|ε_p| ≤ 13.2/m` for
      `p ≥ 2m/3`, `N ≤ 40m/3`, `m ≥ 361` — geometric domination by the
      `r = 2` block (ratio ≤ `(16N/25)/(3(p-2r)(p-2r+1)) ≤ 17.1/p`) plus
      the rational far tail `r > p/4` via `factorial_lb` and
      `(p-1)!/(p-2r+1)! ≥ (2r-1)!`.
      Lean now proves the split, the near-range geometric majorant, the
      rational far-tail geometric bound, `DeltaRat_le_final_envelope`, and
      `Eminus_normalized_residual_le_final`.
- [x] sign-lock §5 (`Prop51/SignLock.lean`): exact finite decomposition
      of `−X_m` and the non-boundary
      `(-ζ)^s/s!·Π_s D_s·(-E^-_{m-s}/(Nc_{m-s}))` summand factorization
      are done; this is also converted to `(1+ε_{m-s})`.  The `Π_s`
      product now has recurrence/product forms, positivity, `Π_s ≥ 1`,
      and the nonnegative extracted residual
      `Π_s - 1 - e₁(s)/m ≥ 0`.  The completed Δ-envelope is exposed as
      `|ε_{m-s}| ≤ 66/(5m)` for `3s ≤ m`.  The final
      rational positivity margin against `2215` is done via a 10-term
      alternating surrogate at `50/27`.  Rational Poisson/partial-exp first
      and second moment bounds are in place, including sharper zeroth/first
      caps for P3a; P2 (`d`-drift) is proved with budget `13/m²`.  P3a now
      has endpoint correction notation, `D_2` ratio-control, pointwise
      recentering control, and weighted budget `184/m²`.  P3b now has the
      sharpened large-`n` reciprocal-binomial estimate, the non-endpoint
      two-block majorant bridge, the pointwise `36.6/m²` cap, and weighted
      budget `234/m²`.  P3c now has an explicit three-and-more-block tail
      majorant, a pointwise `89/m²` cap, and weighted budget `573/m²`.
      P1 now has the higher Poisson moment machinery, the weighted
      `426/m²` numerical majorant budget for the explicit gamma-residual
      terms, plus a closed near-range bridge from the pointwise product/log
      estimate through `piResidualBridgeBound`.  The rational arithmetic
      bounds behind the paper's `L_s ≤ 1.168e₁(s)/m` and `L_s < 0.2237s`
      product estimates are formalized.  The real logarithm bridge now proves
      `log Π_s ≤ L_s`, Taylor-certifies
      `exp(0.2237) ≤ gammaTilt/zetaMax`, and closes both the P1 quadratic
      residual estimate and the P4 `Π_s-1 ≤ L_s·(gammaTilt/zetaMax)^s`
      estimate in the near range.  P4 now has the dominant cross-term
      numerical reserve, and the smaller `u_s v_s`, `v_s|ε_p|`, and
      `v_s|ε_p|u_s` pieces are expanded explicitly inside the `3/2·m⁻²`
      allowance, giving the `784/m²` budget;
      the abstract product-cross inequality has also been bridged to those
      four weighted P4 budget terms.  The formalized near-range `d`-drift
      gives the slightly coarser but sufficient `v_s ≤ (28/25)s/m²`, and the
      `v_s|ε_p|` bridge input is closed.  The closed P1/P4 actual weighted
      bridges are now summed with P2/P3 into a `2214/m²` near-range component
      audit, and a conditional `w_s` near-range theorem records exactly the
      remaining nonlinear recentering hypothesis.  The exact endpoint
      extraction from the `E^-_p` block expansion is now formalized:
      `[t^p]H^2` is split into its two endpoint products plus the middle
      two-block sum, and `ε_p + twoEndpointCorrection` is rewritten as the
      middle two-block normalized contribution plus the `r ≥ 3` tail.  The
      middle two-block absolute-value bridge to the P3b majorant is now
      proved, and the exact `r ≥ 3` tail is reduced to a rationalized
      Δ-tail sum.  The P3c comparison is now closed: the near part of that
      Δ-tail is controlled by a `27/25` geometric multiplier from the `r=3`
      term, and the far slice is bounded by the exact reserve
      `DeltaRatFar ≤ (4/575)·DeltaRatTerm₃`.  Consequently the nonlinear
      recentering hypothesis is discharged and the actual near-range `w_s`
      audit is proved with budget `2214/m²`.  The far-tail work now has the
      exact omitted-tail definition, a rational proof of the finite Poisson
      `2.04` first-omitted-term allowance, the finite-recurrence replacement
      for the TeX truncated saddle estimate `|E^-_p| ≤ 600(6m)^p` for
      `p ≤ 2m/3`, and the algebraic reduction from the actual coefficient
      tail to the displayed saddle/Stirling scalar.  The scalar is now
      certified by an `N`-free envelope, exact endpoint checks at
      `m = 361,362,363`, and a rational three-step contraction; consequently
      the near audit plus the actual far tail is assembled unconditionally as
      a `2215/m²` error-budget wrapper.  The final sign-lock decomposition is
      now split as near alternating base + near signed error + far signed tail,
      and the completed error audit is connected to `Xnorm ≤ -margin`; the
      remaining §5 input is the alternating-base lower bound for
      `signLockNearBase`.  That input is now further reduced to the 12-term
      prefix inequality `signLockBasePrefix ... 12`; the paired alternating
      tail `signLockBaseTailFrom12` is proved nonnegative from adjacent
      even/odd pairs.  The 12-term prefix is also split as
      `A(z)+C(z)/m`, with a formal endpoint-denominator reduction showing
      that it remains only to certify the pure prefix `A(z)` and the
      `m = 361` scalar prefix uniformly for `0 ≤ z ≤ 50/27`; both
      one-variable checks are now certified by explicit rational Bernstein
      coefficient lists, giving the unconditional `Xnorm` sign-lock theorem.
- [ ] positive part §6: rational saddle bounds (`ρ` chosen rational),
      two regimes + `native_decide` window scan `401 ≤ a ≤ 2000`,
      entropy tail for `a > 2000`.  The corrected two-edge rectangle
      bookkeeping and the retained range `1 ≤ k ≤ floor(0.9a)` are now
      formalized in `Prop51/PositiveSaddle.lean`; that file also defines the
      executable rational small/tempered edge summand majorants and proves
      their finite-window exponent cutoffs for `401 ≤ a ≤ 2000`.  The
      abstract reducer from pointwise small/tempered saddle estimates at an
      arbitrary `N` in the rectangle to the corrected two-edge scan is also
      in place, as is the algebraic bridge restricting the guarded raw
      positive sum to `k ≤ floor(0.9a)` once the large-`k` sign-lock
      nonpositivity is available.  `Unorm` is now rewritten as
      `Xnorm + normalizedSoloTerm + normalizedPositiveRangeSum`, with a
      conditional theorem bounding the retained positive sum by the corrected
      edge scan.  The rectangle arithmetic needed to feed the sign-lock
      theorem into the large-`k` exclusion (`k ≥ 361`, `N ≤ 40k/3`) is now
      packaged as a reusable interface.  The final rational margin
      `expNegLower50(1-2/a)-2215/a²` and the `10^-8` positive target are now
      formalized, including the exact proof that the margin dominates the
      target for every `a ≥ 401`; the large-`a` `Unorm < 0` assembly is
      reduced to the remaining `Xnorm` lower bound, pointwise saddle
      estimates, and positive-envelope certificate.  Lean also records the
      main translation interface from §5 to §6: a single uniform theorem
      `Xnorm N m ≤ -signLockMargin m` supplies both the main `m = a`
      negative term and the large-`k` sign-lock exclusion.  This bridge now
      consumes the completed sign-lock theorem directly, while the older
      conditional bridges exposing `signLockNearBase` and the 12-term prefix
      obligations are retained for auditability.  The positive-envelope
      interface now also has a parameterized solo-term bound, matching the
      TeX split between the retained positive summands and the separate
      `2^{-a-1}Y_a(N)` saddle estimate.  These remaining obligations are
      now bundled as `PositiveSaddleCertificate`, split into the finite
      window `401 ≤ a ≤ 2000` and the `a > 2000` entropy tail, and
      `Main.lean` exposes the direct capstone
      `coefficientNegativity_of_positiveSaddleCertificate`.  There is also
      a raw-summand variant `PositiveSaddleRawCertificate` that removes the
      guarded `B_k > 0` bookkeeping from the analytic saddle obligations.
      The raw side now has the exact §6 factorization
      `B_k Q_{a-k}/(N c_a) = (N/2)R_{k,a}2^{-(a-k)}X_kY_{a-k}` in Lean,
      together with wrappers reducing the small/tempered raw obligations to
      factorized bounds only in the case `B_k(N)>0`; this is packaged as
      `PositiveSaddleFactorCertificate`, which converts to the raw and final
      certificate interfaces.  The coefficient-ratio step is also formalized:
      `R_{k,a}` is bounded by the reciprocal binomial prefactor using the
      existing `c_lb`/`c_ub` estimates, and a product bridge reduces the
      factorized summand to separate `X_k(N)` and `Y_{a-k}(N)` bounds; the
      decomposed interface is packaged as `PositiveSaddleXYCertificate`.
      The executable small/tempered majorants also have reciprocal-binomial
      normal forms, matching the scalar shape produced by this bridge.
      Lean now also proves monotonicity of the rational `partialExpUpper`
      surrogate and uses it to move the small-regime exponent from the actual
      `N` to the upper rectangle edge.
- [ ] assembly: `U_a(N) < 0` for `a ≥ 401`; combine with Layers B/A into
      the final `CoefficientNegativity`.  The combination step itself is now
      formalized as `coefficientNegativity_of_unorm_tail`, so the remaining
      assembly input is exactly the large-`a` rectangle theorem for `Unorm`.

## Infrastructure

- [ ] blueprint (`blueprint/`, leanblueprint) with dependency graph.
- [ ] kernel-`decide` variants of small certificates where feasible
      (removes `Lean.ofReduceBool` for those; document which remain native).
- [ ] CI: build + axiom audit (done), `--quick` saddle scan (done),
      doc-gen (later).
