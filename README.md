Formal verification (Lean 4 + mathlib) of the coefficient-negativity theorem
behind **Chen–Larson, Proposition 5.1** (*Independence of tautological classes
and cohomological stability for strata of differentials*,
[arXiv:2603.23850](https://arxiv.org/abs/2603.23850)), together with the
LaTeX proof document and the computational certificates it relies on.

## The theorem

Let `C(t) = Σ_k (6k)!/((3k)!(2k)!) (t/72)^k` and, for a positive partition
`μ = (m_1, …, m_n)` of `2g-2`, let

```
b_a(μ) = [t^a]  Π_i C(t/(m_i+1)) / C(t)^(2g-2+n),    a = ⌊g/3⌋ + 1 .
```

**Target** (`Prop51.CoefficientNegativity` in `Prop51/Main.lean`): for every
`g ≥ 2` with `g ≡ 0, 2 (mod 3)` and every positive partition `μ` of `2g-2`,
`b_a(μ) < 0`.  In particular the coefficient is nonzero, which is the
hypothesis of Chen–Larson Proposition 5.1; via their geometric reduction it
yields their Conjecture 1.4 for holomorphic abelian strata in those residue
classes — for *all* genera, extending their computer verification (`g ≤ 30`).

The proof (see `paper/prop51.tex`) has three layers:

| layer | range | method | formal status |
|---|---|---|---|
| enumeration | `g ≤ 23` (`a ≤ 8`) | exact rationals over all partitions | **proved** (`CertificateSmall.lean`) |
| majorant, exact | `9 ≤ a ≤ 60` | exact rationals, 10,764 pairs | **proved** (`CertificateExact.lean`) |
| majorant, interval | `61 ≤ a ≤ 400` | 192-bit ball arithmetic, 480,984 pairs | external Arb certificate (`certificates/`), Lean port = Layer B |
| effective tail | `a ≥ 401` | explicit sign-lock `C₂ = 2215` + saddle bounds | paper-level, Lean port = Layer C |

## What is machine-checked today

All Lean proofs are sorry-free.  Headline theorems:

* `Prop51.bCoeff_neg_g_le_23` — `b_a(μ) < 0` for every generated partition,
  every relevant `g ≤ 23` (≈150k partitions; cardinalities cross-checked
  against p(n)).
* `Prop51.unorm_neg_9_60` — the normalized majorant `U_a(N)/(N c_a)` is
  negative on the entire rectangle `9 ≤ a ≤ 60`, `6a-7 ≤ N ≤ 12a-8`,
  with the exact corner value pinned at `(9,100)`.
* **`Prop51.coefficientNegativity_of_g_le_179`** — the capstone: for every
  `2 ≤ g ≤ 179` with `g ≡ 0,2 (mod 3)` and every positive partition of
  `2g-2`, the Proposition 5.1 coefficient is negative.  Layer A (the
  power-series bridge `Cseries = expSeries c`, the official characterization
  `C^N · Σ b_a X^a = Π C(X/qᵢ)`, and the majorant inequality) is fully
  formalized with **no computational axioms**; only the finite certificates
  use `native_decide`.
* Spec lemmas (`Prop51/Defs.lean`): the computational definitions satisfy
  their defining recurrences (`c_succ_succ`, `cList_getD_eq`, …) — these
  carry no computational axioms.

## Trust model

Certificate theorems are proved by `native_decide`, so they depend on the
axioms `Lean.ofReduceBool` and `Lean.trustCompiler` (evaluation by the Lean
compiler) in addition to the three standard axioms.  `scripts/AxiomsReport.lean` prints the axioms of
every headline theorem; CI fails if anything beyond
`propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound, Lean.ofReduceBool, Lean.trustCompiler` appears, or if any
`sorry` is present.  Definitional/spec lemmas use no computational axioms.

## Building

```sh
lake exe cache get   # fetch prebuilt mathlib oleans
lake build           # builds everything incl. the native_decide certificates
lake env lean scripts/AxiomsReport.lean   # axiom audit
```

Pinned: Lean `v4.27.0`, mathlib `v4.27.0`.  On WSL, build from a clone on the
Linux filesystem (e.g. `~/lean/`), not from `/mnt/c` — I/O there dominates
build time.

## Relation to the paper

`paper/prop51.tex` is the human proof this repository formalizes.  Two
*errata* against its tenth revision, found during formalization review, are
recorded in `paper/ERRATA.md` (neither affects the conclusions).
