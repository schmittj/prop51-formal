# Main statements

This file isolates the target theorem of the project and records exactly
what is proved so far.  It deliberately imports only the definition layer and
the finite certificates.

## The target

`CoefficientNegativity` is the full Chen–Larson Proposition 5.1 coefficient
statement (arXiv:2603.23850): for every genus `g ≥ 2` with `g ≡ 0, 2 (mod 3)`
and every positive partition `μ` of `2g - 2`, the coefficient
`b_{⌊g/3⌋+1}(μ)` is negative (in particular nonzero, which is the hypothesis
of Proposition 5.1 there).

## Status

* `coefficientNegativity_of_g_le_1199` : proved — the enumeration (`g ≤ 23`),
  the exact-rational certificate (`9 ≤ a ≤ 60`), the verified dyadic
  interval certificate (`61 ≤ a ≤ 400`, Layer B), and the Layer A majorant
  bridge `b_a(μ) ≤ U_a(N)` (paper eq. 8) together cover every relevant
  genus `g ≤ 1199` and every positive partition.
* `a ≥ 401` (effective analytic bound): not yet formalized — Layer C of the
  roadmap; it would upgrade the capstone to full `CoefficientNegativity`.

/-- `μ` is a positive partition of `n`: a list of positive parts summing to
`n`.  (Order is irrelevant to `bCoeff`, which only uses the multiset of
parts; we do not impose sortedness.) -/

  μ.sum = n ∧ ∀ m ∈ μ, 1 ≤ m

/-- **The target statement.**  Negativity of the Chen–Larson Proposition 5.1
coefficient for all relevant genera and all positive partitions.  Proving
this proposition (sorry-free, with the power-series bridge of Layer A) is the
goal of this repository. -/

/-- What is currently machine-checked towards `CoefficientNegativity` for
small genus: every *generated* partition for every relevant `g ≤ 23`.
Upgrading `∀ μ ∈ partitions (2g-2)` to `∀ μ, IsPartitionOf μ (2g-2)` needs
the generator-completeness lemma plus permutation-invariance of `bCoeff`
(ROADMAP, Layer A′). -/

/-- **Small-genus case of the target, in full generality**: for every
relevant `g ≤ 23` and *every* positive partition `μ` of `2g-2` (arbitrary
order, arbitrary list representation), the Chen–Larson coefficient is
negative.  Combines the machine-checked enumeration with generator
completeness (`mem_partitions_iff`) and permutation-invariance of `bCoeff`. -/

/-- **The capstone of Layers 0+A**: for every genus `2 ≤ g ≤ 179` with
`g ≡ 0, 2 (mod 3)` and *every* positive partition `μ` of `2g-2`, the
Chen–Larson Proposition 5.1 coefficient is negative.

Combines: the small-genus enumeration (`g ≤ 23`), the exact-rational
majorant certificate (`9 ≤ a ≤ 60`, i.e. `24 ≤ g ≤ 179`), and the majorant
inequality `b_a(μ) ≤ N c_a · Unorm a N` of `Prop51.Majorant`.  The
quantification over `μ` is the honest predicate form (`IsPartitionOf`). -/
